PyMFEM is a SWIG Wrapper for MFEM, finite element method library
(http://mfem.org).
PyMFEM allows to call this c++ library from python, and extend
the library so that a user can use python object instead of
passing c++ function pointer.

-- Module structure --
  <root>/mfem/ser : wrapper for serial MFEM
             /par : wrapper for parallel MFEM
             /Makefile_tempates: example template

-- INSTALLATION --

0: 3rd parth libs
  0-1) mpi4py
         needed either you use parallel MFEM or MUMPS.
  0-2) MFEM
         needless to say!?
	 serial version and parallel version need to be
	 compiled at separate directory.

  0-2) HYPRE
	 Needed if parallel MFEM is used

1:  recompile MFEM with -fPIC option
    This may not be necessary. (I didn't need it on MacOSX, 
    I don't know why)     

2: Prepare Makefile.local
   copy template from Makefile_template/* to repository root.
   rename it as Makefile.local
   edit it for your enviroment

   Leaving MFEMSER in Makefile.local  skips building serial version.
   Leaving MFEM in Makefile.local  skips building parallel version.   
   
2-1 (Optional): Build SWIG cxx files
This is needed only when you edit SWIG interface files.
   * make cxx

   or
   
   * make sercxx (sereal MFEM wrapepr)
   * make parcxx (parallel MFEM wrapper)
	
3: Compile Extensions
   * make
   or 
   * make ser (sereal MFEM wrapepr)
   * make par (parallel MFEM wrapper)

-- Features --
 PyMFEM realized a couple of features, which does not exists in the
 original MFEM.
 Some of them are made to the wrapper simply more python-like.
 Some of them are better to be integrated to MFEM itself in future.
 
  4-1) mfem::Vector
     Constructor using pthon list:   v = mfem.Vector([1,2,3])
     Array element access:  print v[0] or v[0] = 3
     Assign method:         v.Assign(1) (equivalent to v=1 in c++)
     Data Access as Numpy:  v.GetDataArray()

  4-2) mfem::Coefficient
       PyCoefficient is derived from FunctionCoefficient
       PyCoefficientT is time-dependent version
       VectorPyCoefficient  is derveid from VectorFunctionCoefficient
       VectorPyCoefficientT is time-dependent version

       When using these class, inherit one of them and define
       cls::EvalValue method as follows

       class Jt(mfem.VectorPyCoefficient):
           def EvalValue(self, x):
               return [0.,0.,  np.cos(np.abs(x[2]-0.03)/0.03*np.pi/2)]
       class Sigma(mfem.PyCoefficient):
           def EvalValue(self, x):
               return 0.01   // need to return 

       then use it

       Cof_Jt = Jt(3) // VectorPyCoefficient constructor need sdim 
       dd = mfem.VectorFEBoundaryTangentLFIntegrator(Cof_Jt);

  4-3) mfem::GridFunction
       GetNodalValues(i) will perform GetNodalValue(Vector(), i) and
       return numpy array of Vector()
  

  4-4) mfem::Mesh
         Wrapper of following methods are customized to
	 return either python list object or tuple of lists
	  
            GetBdrElementVertices(i)
            GetElementVertices(i)
            GetElementVEdges(i)
            GetBdrElementEdges(i)
            GetFaceEdges(i)
            GetEdgeVertices(i)
            GetFaceVertices(i)
            GetElementFaces(i)

         Additional constructors:
	    # this one takes file name as string
	    Mesh(const char *mesh_file, int generate_edges, int refine,
                 bool fix_orientation = True)
		 
	    # this one takes element type as string
            Mesh(int nx, int ny, int nz, const char *type, int generate_edges = 0,
              double sx = 1.0, double sy = 1.0, double sz = 1.0)
            Mesh(int nx, int ny, const char *type, int generate_edges = 0,
              double sx = 1.0, double sy = 1.0)
	      
	    (note) an issue is Element::Type (c++ enum) is treated as int in
	    python, and therefore, the wrapper can not disingish it from the
	    following constructor.
              Mesh(int _Dim, int NVert, int NElem, int NBdrElem = 0,
    	           int _spaceDim= -1)
         
         GetVertexArray can be used to obtain Vertex point data
	 as numpy object

         GetBdrElementFace(i) returns tuple
         GetBdrArray(int idx) returns array of boundary whose BdrAttribute is idx
         GetBdrAttributeArray(int idx) returns array of boundary attribute

  4-5) sparsemat
         RAP has two different implementations. One accept three references.
	 The other accept a pointer as a third argument, instead.
	 These two are not distinguishable from python. So, RAP_P and
	 RAP_R are added. P indicates the third argment is pointer.
	 
  4-6) estimators
        ZienkiewiczZhuEstimator constructor has two versions. flux_fes
	can be passed as pointer or reference. In python class, you
	need to pass 5th argument if you want to pass flux_fes as
	reference. By default,  own_flux_fes is  False, so a user
	can skip passing this keyword when passing by reference
	
	pass by reference 
          ZienkiewiczZhuEstimator(integ, sol, flux_fes, own_flux_fes = False)	  
        pass by pointer
          ZienkiewiczZhuEstimator(integ, sol, flux_fes, own_flux_fes = True)	  
  (below is not yet implement in parallel version)
  4-7) operator
        PyTimeDependentOperatorBase and PyOperatorBase is added to
	allow for implementing those operator in python. A user
	can inherit these class and overwrite Mult in python. See
	ex9.py for example.
	
  4-8) ode
        Step usins reference passing for t and dt. To get the result
	from this method, use
	   t, dt = ode_solver.Step(u, t, dt)
